**Prism-Bukkit** is a Bukkit plugin that tracks changes to a Minecraft world. These changes can be looked
up, rolled back, restored, etc. There are also various anti-griefing tools.

This is a continuation of @viveleroi's work, with various fixes and feature
additions by a few GitHub contributors, now maintained by [AddstarMC][ADDSTARMC].

For information on how to use Prism, [see the wiki][WIKI].

# Support

In 2016, Prism-Bukkit was abandoned in favor of the [Sponge rewrite][SPONGE]. Shortly after, [the AddstarMC team][ADDSTARMC] forked
the project for use on their own server and has continued maintaining it ever since. With the blessing of @viveleroi,
we have now published this to SpigotMC and are providing support on the [M.O.S.S. discord server][MOSS].

**Prism only supports Spigot/Paper 1.15+ - We will not be adding support for older versions!**
